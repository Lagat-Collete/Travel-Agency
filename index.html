        <h2>Amboseli National Park</h2>
        <img src="./images/T1.jpg" alt="Amboseli national park image">
        <p>Beyond the world-famous safari parks lies a trove of coastal treasures. You can snorkel and
           dive fish-rich coral reefs, relax on pearly beaches, experience the melting pot
            of cultures and cuisines in Mombasa and Malindi,
            and explore tropical islands steeped in Swahili history.</p>

        <h2>Maasai Mara National Reserve</h2>
        <img src="./images/T2.jpg" alt="Maasai Mara National Reserve image">
        <p>It's named after the statuesque, red-cloaked Maasai people who live in
           the park and graze their animals here, as they have done for centuries. 
          In their language, Mara means "mottled," perhaps a reference to the play of 
          light and shadow from the acacia trees and cloud-studded skies on the vast grasslands.</p>
